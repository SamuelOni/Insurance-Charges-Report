## Insights
### Charges Insights
- Total revenue from charges was $ 17,755,824 with 1338 active policyholders across four regions.
- The South East region was the highest contributor to revenue with 364 policyholders and a total charges of $5,363,690
- The insurance policy package is attracting younger clients as 18-27 year olds were the largest group of policy holders
- This is further evidenced by the low average premium charged on younger policyholders ($9,098)
- There was a clear upward trend noticed in the average charges by age which meant that the older the policyholder the higher the charges they had to pay.
- Also, overweight or obese policyholders were charged significantly higher than normal weight policyholders (up to 100% more).

### Core Insight
Using a **Simple Linear Regression Analysis**, we discover that there is a clear relationship between smoking habits and higher charges as policyholders who identifies as smokers tend to pay $32,825 more than non-smokers. This tells us that the company charges a premium on smokers as they are more likely to develop health complications over time.

## Recommendations
- More resources should be allocated to the South East region as it is currently the largest market.
- Advertising should be further targeted at 18 - 27 year olds who are non smokers, highlighting lower cost compared to competitors, a reward for healthy living. While they are bound to pay less, thier healthy lifestyle ideally reduces the risk of a potential payout.

## Conclusion
Through this insurance charges analysis, we are able to uncover trends in, regional sales demographics, charges correlation with smoking habits and BMI. These insights can inform stakeolders particularly Sales Execs and Actuaries on how to further optimize charges structure and product messaging to improve the bottom line.
